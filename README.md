### Eñvorennoù

###### *An acousmatic experience of breton language*
###### Listen [here](mankemonk.github.io )

Between sound soetry and concrete music, Eñvorennoù explores some Breton's noticeable phonetics and accents. Mixed for 8 channels
and downscaled to stereo trough almost-binaural process, it's best listened with headphones.

Everything you can hear is *only* voice.
